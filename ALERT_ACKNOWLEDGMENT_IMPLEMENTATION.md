# Alert Acknowledgment System Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented a comprehensive Alert Acknowledgment System with timeline tracking, user attribution, and status updates.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Schema
- Updated `AcknowledgeAlertSchema` with:
  - `urgencyAssessment`: 'maintain' | 'increase' | 'decrease'
  - `responseAction`: 'responding' | 'delayed' | 'delegating' | 'monitoring'
  - `estimatedResponseTime`: number (minutes)
  - `delegateTo`: UUID (for delegation)
  - `notes`: string (optional)

### 2. Database Updates
- Added new columns to `alert_acknowledgments` table
- Created indexes for performance
- Migration applied successfully

### 3. Backend API Enhancements
- Enhanced `acknowledgeAlert` mutation with:
  - Validation based on response action
  - Urgency level updates
  - Timeline event creation
  - Delegation support
  - Escalation timer cancellation
- Added `getAlert` query for single alert details
- Added `getOnDutyStaff` query for delegation options
- Added `getAlertTimeline` query for timeline events

### 4. Frontend Components

#### Alert Timeline Component (`/components/healthcare/AlertTimeline.tsx`)
- Visual timeline of all alert events
- Icons and colors for different event types
- Metadata display for acknowledgments
- Loading and empty states
- Responsive design

#### Acknowledge Alert Modal (`/app/(modals)/acknowledge-alert.tsx`)
- Real-time alert data fetching
- Dynamic form based on response action
- Staff delegation when needed
- Estimated time quick selection
- Form validation
- Loading states
- Error handling

#### Alert Details Page (`/app/(healthcare)/alert-details.tsx`)
- Complete alert information display
- Timeline visualization
- Escalation warnings
- Action buttons based on user role
- Pull-to-refresh
- Real-time updates

### 5. Features Implemented
- **Urgency Assessment**: Staff can maintain, increase, or decrease urgency
- **Response Actions**: 
  - Responding immediately
  - Responding with delay
  - Delegating to another staff member
  - Monitoring remotely
- **Timeline Tracking**: All actions are recorded with timestamps
- **User Attribution**: Every action is linked to the user who performed it
- **Escalation Integration**: Acknowledgment cancels escalation timers
- **Role-Based Access**: Only authorized roles can acknowledge

## Usage

### For Healthcare Staff
1. View active alerts in the dashboard
2. Click on an alert to see details
3. Click "Acknowledge Alert" button
4. Select urgency assessment
5. Choose response action
6. Enter estimated response time (if responding)
7. Select staff member (if delegating)
8. Add optional notes
9. Submit acknowledgment

### For Administrators
- View complete timeline of all alert actions
- Track response times and patterns
- Monitor escalation events
- Audit trail for compliance

## API Endpoints

```typescript
// Acknowledge an alert
healthcare.acknowledgeAlert({
  alertId: string,
  urgencyAssessment: 'maintain' | 'increase' | 'decrease',
  responseAction: 'responding' | 'delayed' | 'delegating' | 'monitoring',
  estimatedResponseTime?: number,
  delegateTo?: string,
  notes?: string
})

// Get alert details
healthcare.getAlert({ alertId: string })

// Get on-duty staff
healthcare.getOnDutyStaff({ 
  hospitalId: string,
  role?: 'doctor' | 'nurse' | 'head_doctor'
})

// Get alert timeline
healthcare.getAlertTimeline({ alertId: string })
```

## Next Steps
1. Add resolve alert functionality
2. Implement alert comments/notes
3. Add notification when delegated
4. Create acknowledgment analytics
5. Add response time tracking dashboard
