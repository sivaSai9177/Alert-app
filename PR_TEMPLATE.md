# Pull Request: Unified Environment Configuration for OAuth Compatibility

## 🎯 Purpose

This PR introduces a unified environment configuration system that solves OAuth authentication issues with private IP addresses while maintaining mobile device connectivity.

## 🐛 Problem Statement

- **OAuth Issue**: Google OAuth doesn't accept private IP addresses (192.168.x.x), causing authentication failures
- **Environment Confusion**: Multiple `.env` files and configurations made it difficult to manage different scenarios
- **Mobile Connectivity**: When using localhost for OAuth, mobile devices couldn't connect to the API

## ✅ Solution

Implemented a unified environment system that:
- Automatically detects the appropriate mode (local/network/tunnel/production)
- Uses localhost for auth endpoints when on private networks (OAuth requirement)
- Allows API access via network IP for mobile devices
- Provides a single, clear configuration system

## 📝 Changes

### New Files
- `lib/core/unified-env.ts` - Centralized environment configuration
- `scripts/start-unified.sh` - Unified start script for all modes
- `.env.local.example` - Template for local OAuth configuration

### Updated Files
- `lib/auth/auth.ts` - Uses `getAuthBaseUrl()` from unified-env
- `lib/auth/auth-client.ts` - Uses OAuth-safe URLs
- `lib/trpc.tsx` - Uses unified API URL
- `lib/core/env.ts` - Exports unified functions
- `package.json` - Added unified scripts

## 🚀 New Commands

```bash
bun start:oauth    # OAuth testing (everything on localhost)
bun start          # Network mode (mobile devices via IP, auth on localhost)
bun start:local    # Local development mode
bun start:tunnel   # Remote access via Expo tunnel
```

## 🧪 Testing

- [x] OAuth authentication works with `bun start:oauth`
- [x] Mobile devices can connect with `bun start`
- [x] Profile completion flow works after OAuth
- [x] No breaking changes to existing functionality
- [x] All TypeScript types are correct

## 📋 Migration Guide

1. Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`
2. Update with your OAuth credentials
3. Use the new unified commands
4. Remove old environment-specific configurations

## 🔄 Breaking Changes

⚠️ **BREAKING**: Environment configuration has been unified. Users need to update their local environment files according to `.env.local.example`.

## 📸 Screenshots/Evidence

### Before
```
Error: OAuth authentication failed
Network request failed: private IP address not allowed
```

### After
```
✅ OAuth authentication successful
✅ Mobile devices connected
✅ Profile completion flow working
```
