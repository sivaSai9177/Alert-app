## Role-Based UX Patterns Applied

### Visual Hierarchy
1. **Critical Information First**: Patient name, room number, alert type
2. **Status Indicators**: Consistent use of badges and icons
3. **Time-Based Color Coding**: Response times use traffic light system

### Interaction Patterns
1. **One-Tap Actions**: Quick acknowledge buttons on all alert cards
2. **Bulk Operations**: Checkbox selection for multiple items
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Basic info visible, details on tap

### Accessibility Features
1. **Large Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px for all interactive elements
2. **High Contrast**: Clear distinction between states
3. **Icon + Text**: All icons accompanied by text labels

## Data Structure Consistency

All screens use consistent data structures:
- Alert IDs for linking
- Timestamp tracking for all events
- User attribution for actions
- Status enums matching PRD specifications

## Next Steps

1. **Create Modal Screens**:
   - alert-details.tsx
   - acknowledge-alert.tsx
   - escalation-details.tsx

2. **Create Healthcare Blocks**:
   - 8 modular blocks for dashboard composition

3. **Implement Real Features**:
   - WebSocket subscriptions
   - Actual API integration
   - Push notifications

## Technical Notes

- All screens use RefreshControl for pull-to-refresh
- Consistent spacing using Zustand store
- Theme-aware color usage
- Mock data structured to match expected API responses
- Prepared for real-time updates with subscription placeholders
