**Date**: January 8, 2025  
**Author**: Hospital Alert Team  
**Status**: In Review  

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Purpose
The Hospital Alert System is a critical real-time notification platform designed to streamline emergency communication within hospitals. It enables operators to create alerts that are instantly delivered to medical staff (doctors, nurses, head doctors) based on urgency levels, with automatic escalation for unacknowledged alerts.

### 1.2 Scope
**Included in MVP**:
- Multi-platform support (Android, iOS, Web)
- Role-based authentication (Operator, Doctor, Nurse, Head Doctor)
- Alert creation and management system
- Real-time push notifications
- Acknowledgment tracking
- Automatic escalation logic
- Activity logs and audit trails

**Excluded from MVP**:
- Integration with existing hospital systems (EMR, paging)
- SMS/Email notifications
- Detailed analytics dashboards
- Multi-hospital support
- Offline mode

### 1.3 Definitions
- **Alert**: An emergency notification created by an operator
- **Acknowledgment**: Confirmation by medical staff that they've received and are responding to an alert
- **Escalation**: Automatic forwarding of unacknowledged alerts to higher authority
- **Operator**: Hospital staff responsible for creating alerts
- **Response Time**: Duration between alert creation and acknowledgment

## 2. Problem Statement

### 2.1 Current Situation
Hospital emergency response systems often rely on outdated methods:
- Manual phone calls or overhead paging
- No tracking of who received or acknowledged alerts
- Delays in reaching the right personnel
- No automatic escalation for ignored alerts
- Poor visibility into response times and patterns

### 2.2 Desired Outcome
A modern, mobile-first alert system that:
- Instantly notifies relevant staff based on roles
- Tracks acknowledgments in real-time
- Automatically escalates unacknowledged alerts
- Provides complete audit trails
- Works seamlessly across all devices

### 2.3 Success Criteria
- **Response Time**: Average acknowledgment within 2 minutes
- **Delivery Rate**: 99.9% successful notification delivery
- **Escalation Success**: 95% of alerts acknowledged before final escalation
- **User Adoption**: 90% of staff actively using the system within 30 days
