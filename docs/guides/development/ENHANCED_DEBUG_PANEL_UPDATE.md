# Enhanced Debug Panel Update

## Overview
Updated the EnhancedDebugPanel component to use the new ScrollContainer with native iOS-style sticky header.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Updated EnhancedDebugPanel Component**
- Integrated `ScrollContainer` with sticky header functionality
- Added "Debug Console" as the header title
- Added a close button in the header using the universal Button component
- Removed duplicate SafeAreaView since ScrollContainer handles it
- Fixed React Hook order issues with useCallback

### 2. **Removed Old DebugPanel**
- Deleted the old `DebugPanel.tsx` component as it's replaced by `EnhancedDebugPanel.tsx`
- The app already uses EnhancedDebugPanel in `_layout.tsx`

### 3. **Benefits**
- **Native Feel**: Debug panel now has iOS-style sticky header that appears on scroll
- **Consistent UI**: Uses the same ScrollContainer component as other pages
- **Better UX**: Header with close button provides easy navigation
- **Clean Code**: Removed duplicate component and fixed linting issues

## Features
- Sticky header appears when scrolling in the debug panel
- Close button in header for easy dismissal
- Maintains all existing debug functionality:
  - Log filtering and search
  - TanStack Query debugging
  - Auth state display
  - Log export capabilities
  - Real-time log updates

## Usage
The debug panel continues to work the same way:
1. Tap the floating debug button (üêõ) in development mode
2. View logs, auth state, and TanStack Query info
3. Use the sticky header close button or modal backdrop to dismiss

## Technical Details
- Uses `ScrollContainer` component with `headerTitle` and `headerChildren` props
- Maintains modal presentation for full-screen debug experience
- Auto-refresh functionality preserved with proper useCallback implementation
