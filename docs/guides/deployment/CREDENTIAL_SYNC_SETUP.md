# 🔄 Credential Syncing Setup

Based on https://docs.expo.dev/app-signing/syncing-credentials/

## 🎯 **Current Status:**

✅ **Android Build**: Currently building with local credentials  
✅ **Local Keystore**: Generated and configured  
⏳ **Android APK**: Building now (takes 10-15 minutes)  

## 🔄 **Credential Syncing Options:**

### **Option 1: Keep Local Credentials**
- ✅ **Pros**: Full control, no EAS dependency
- ✅ **Best for**: Development builds

### **Option 2: Sync to EAS**
Upload local credentials to EAS for team sharing:

```bash
# Upload Android keystore to EAS
eas credentials:configure --platform android

# Upload iOS certificates to EAS  
eas credentials:configure --platform ios
```

### **Option 3: Download from EAS**
If you have existing EAS credentials:

```bash
# Download credentials from EAS
eas credentials:sync
```

## 📱 **Current Build Progress:**

**Android Build Status:**
- ✅ Local credentials configured
- ✅ Gradle downloading 
- ⏳ Building APK (10-15 minutes)
- 📍 Will be saved locally when complete

## 🍎 **iOS Setup (Next):**

For iOS development builds, you'll need:

1. **Apple Developer Account** (free or paid)
2. **Development Certificate**
3. **Development Provisioning Profile**

**Quick iOS Setup:**
```bash
# Generate iOS credentials automatically
eas credentials:configure --platform ios --local
```

## 🎯 **Recommended Workflow:**

1. ✅ **Android**: Use current local build (in progress)
2. 🍎 **iOS**: Generate local credentials next
3. 🔄 **Sync**: Upload to EAS for team sharing later

## 📊 **Monitor Android Build:**

The current Android build is progressing:
- Downloaded Gradle 8.13
- Starting build process
- Will generate APK in `/var/folders/.../build/android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`

**Build will complete automatically!**

## 🚀 **After Android Build:**

1. ✅ **Install APK** on Android device
2. 🍎 **Start iOS build** with local credentials
3. 🧪 **Test OAuth flow** with both apps

**Android build is progressing well!** Would you like me to prepare iOS credentials while Android builds?
