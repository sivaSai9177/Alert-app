## New Structure Benefits

1. **Clear Categories**: Documentation is now organized by purpose (getting started, development, deployment, etc.)
2. **Reduced Nesting**: Flatter structure makes files easier to find
3. **Logical Grouping**: Related files are grouped together
4. **Better Discoverability**: INDEX.md provides clear navigation paths
5. **Scalability**: Structure can easily accommodate new documentation

## Navigation Tips

- Start with `/docs/INDEX.md` for the main navigation
- Use category folders to browse related documentation
- Check the archive folder for historical documentation
- Multi-agent documentation remains in its dedicated folder
- Design system docs include performance optimization guides

## Next Steps

1. Consider moving more historical docs to the archive folder
2. Update any internal links that may have broken
3. Add README files to major category folders
4. Consider consolidating similar documents

The documentation is now much more organized and easier to navigate!
