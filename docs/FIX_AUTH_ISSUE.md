# Authentication Issue Fix Guide

## Problem
The authentication is failing with "Authentication required" errors because:
1. Old multiSession cookies are interfering with the authentication
2. Better Auth is looking for cookies with different naming formats
3. The session is not being properly passed to TRPC requests

## Solution Steps

### 1. Clear Old Session (Required First Step)
Since you have old multiSession cookies that are interfering:

1. **Navigate to the login page**: http://localhost:8081/(auth)/login
2. **Click "Clear Session (Debug)"** button at the bottom left (only visible in development)
3. This will clear all old cookies and localStorage
4. You'll be redirected to login

### 2. Sign In Fresh
1. Log in with one of the demo accounts:
   - Operator: johncena@gmail.com (any password)
   - Nurse: doremon@gmail.com (any password)
   - Doctor: johndoe@gmail.com (any password)
   - Head Doctor: saipramod273@gmail.com (any password)

### 3. Verify Authentication
After logging in, you should be redirected to the healthcare dashboard without authentication errors.

## What Was Fixed

1. **Removed multiSession plugin** - This was creating cookies with incompatible naming
2. **Updated cookie configuration** - Changed from `better-auth.session-token` to `better-auth.session_token`
3. **Added CORS cookie header** - Added 'Cookie' to allowed headers in TRPC endpoint
4. **Enhanced cookie handling** - Added debugging and fallback mechanisms
5. **Created session clearing utility** - To remove old interfering cookies

## If Issues Persist

1. **Check Browser Console** for cookie debugging info
2. **Clear browser data manually**:
   - Open DevTools > Application > Storage
   - Clear all cookies for localhost
   - Clear localStorage
3. **Restart the server**: `bun run local:healthcare`

## Technical Details

The issue was that Better Auth's multiSession plugin creates cookies like:
- `better-auth.session_token_multi-xyz...`

But the standard Better Auth expects:
- `better-auth.session_token`

By removing the multiSession plugin and clearing old cookies, the authentication should work correctly.
