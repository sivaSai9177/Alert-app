# Button Activation Fix Summary

## Problem
The sign-in and sign-up buttons were not activating when users entered valid credentials because they relied on `form.formState.isValid`, which only updates after fields have been touched/validated.

## Solution
Implemented custom validation logic that checks form values in real-time, enabling the button as soon as valid values are entered.

## Login Form Implementation

### Custom Validation Logic
```typescript
const hasValidValues = React.useMemo(() => {
  const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
  const isEmailValid = email && emailRegex.test(email);
  const isPasswordValid = password && password.length >= 1;
  
  return isEmailValid && isPasswordValid;
}, [email, password]);
```

### Button State
- Button enables when:
  - Email has valid format
  - Password has at least 1 character
  - Not currently loading

## Signup Form Implementation

### Custom Validation Logic
```typescript
const hasValidValues = React.useMemo(() => {
  const { name, email, password, confirmPassword, role } = formValues;
  
  const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
  const hasName = name && name.length >= 2;
  const hasValidEmail = email && emailRegex.test(email);
  const hasPassword = password && password.length >= 12;
  const passwordsMatch = password === confirmPassword;
  const hasRole = !!role;
  
  return hasName && hasValidEmail && hasPassword && 
         passwordsMatch && hasRole && acceptTerms && acceptPrivacy;
}, [formValues, acceptTerms, acceptPrivacy]);
```

### Button State
- Button enables when:
  - Name has at least 2 characters
  - Email has valid format
  - Password has at least 12 characters
  - Password and confirm password match
  - Role is selected
  - Terms and privacy are accepted
  - Not currently loading

## User Experience
1. **Immediate Feedback**: Button activates as soon as all requirements are met
2. **No Touch Required**: Works even if users haven't blurred fields
3. **Real-time Validation**: Updates with every keystroke
4. **Clear Requirements**: Users can see what's needed for activation

## Technical Details
- Uses `React.useMemo` for efficient re-computation
- Watches form values with `form.watch()`
- Basic regex validation for email format
- Maintains all existing validation for form submission
- Progressive enhancement - full validation still runs on submit
