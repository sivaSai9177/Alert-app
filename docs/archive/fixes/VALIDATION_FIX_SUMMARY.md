# Form Validation Fix Summary

## Problem
Forms were showing red validation errors immediately when the page loaded, before users had a chance to interact with the fields.

## Solution
Changed the validation strategy from aggressive immediate validation to user-friendly progressive validation:

### 1. **Form Configuration Changes**
```typescript
// Before:
mode: "onChange", // Validates on every keystroke
// After:
mode: "onTouched", // Validates only after user leaves the field
```

### 2. **Login Form Updates**
- Removed the `useEffect` that was triggering validation on mount
- Changed validation mode from `onChange` to `onTouched`
- Added `onBlur` handlers to inputs to trigger validation when user leaves field
- Updated button disable logic to only disable after form submission attempt
- Now validation errors only show after:
  - User focuses and then leaves a field (blur)
  - User attempts to submit the form

### 3. **Signup Form Updates**
- Changed validation mode from `onChange` to `onTouched`
- Form already had proper field-level validation triggers

## User Experience Improvements
1. **No red errors on page load** - Fields start clean
2. **Progressive validation** - Errors appear only after user interaction
3. **Real-time feedback** - Once a field is touched, it provides immediate feedback on subsequent changes
4. **Submit button always enabled initially** - Only disables after a failed submission attempt

## Technical Details
- Using `react-hook-form`'s built-in validation modes
- `onTouched` mode validates on blur events
- `reValidateMode: "onChange"` provides real-time feedback after initial validation
- Form state properties used:
  - `touchedFields` - Tracks which fields user has interacted with
  - `isSubmitted` - Tracks if form submission was attempted
  - `isValid` - Indicates if all fields pass validation

This approach follows UX best practices by not overwhelming users with errors before they've had a chance to input data.
