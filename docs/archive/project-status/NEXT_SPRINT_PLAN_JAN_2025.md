2. **Test Coverage**: May not reach 80%
   - *Mitigation*: Prioritize critical path tests
   
3. **Bundle Size**: May be difficult to reduce
   - *Mitigation*: Consider lazy loading non-critical features

4. **Resource Availability**: Team capacity
   - *Mitigation*: Clear task ownership and daily standups
