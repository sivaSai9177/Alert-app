# Console.log Cleanup Fixes Complete

## All Syntax Errors Fixed ✅

### Files Fixed:
1. **`/lib/auth/session-manager.ts`** - 3 malformed TODO comments fixed
2. **`/lib/stores/auth-store.ts`** - 1 malformed TODO comment fixed  
3. **`/lib/trpc.tsx`** - Multiple logging statements fixed
4. **`/lib/auth/auth-client.ts`** - 5 malformed TODO comments fixed
5. **`/lib/auth/auth.ts`** - 2 malformed TODO comments fixed
6. **`/lib/core/env-config.ts`** - 1 large multi-line console.log with emojis fixed

### Issue:
The console.log cleanup script created TODO comments but didn't properly comment out the JavaScript object syntax, causing syntax errors like:
```javascript
// TODO: Replace with structured logging - console.log('[AUTH CLIENT] Initialized:', {
    platform: Platform.OS,  // <-- This line wasn't commented
    baseURL: BASE_URL,      // <-- This line wasn't commented
  });
```

### Solution:
Replaced all malformed TODO comments with proper structured logging:
```javascript
log.info('Auth client initialized', 'AUTH_CLIENT', {
    platform: Platform.OS,
    baseURL: BASE_URL,
});
```

## Current Status:
- ✅ All syntax errors fixed
- ✅ Proper structured logging implemented
- ✅ Log imports added where needed
- ✅ App starts without errors
- ✅ Healthcare setup completes successfully

## How to Run:
```bash
# Start with healthcare setup
bun run local:healthcare

# Or start normally
bun run local
```

The app should now work exactly as it did before, but with:
- Better structured logging
- Unified environment configuration from expo-agentic-starter
- Fixed shadow prop handling in Card component
- No console.log statements in production code
