# Healthcare Setup Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Environment-Aware Database Configuration
- The system now automatically detects and uses the correct database based on `APP_ENV`
- **Local**: Uses Docker PostgreSQL (`localhost:5432`)
- **Development/Staging/Production**: Uses Neon Cloud Database
- Database configuration is handled by `src/db/index.ts` which auto-detects local vs cloud

### 2. Healthcare Database Schema
Created comprehensive healthcare tables:
- `hospitals` - Hospital information
- `healthcare_users` - Healthcare-specific user data (linked to main user table)
- `alerts` - Emergency alerts created by operators
- `alert_escalations` - Track alert escalation history
- `alert_responses` - Track responses to alerts

### 3. Healthcare Setup Scripts
Created environment-aware setup scripts:
- `scripts/setup-healthcare-local.ts` - Main setup script that works with any environment
- `scripts/start-with-healthcare.sh` - Unified startup script that handles healthcare setup
- `scripts/start-expo-go-local.sh` - Local-specific script with healthcare check

### 4. Package.json Commands
Added convenient commands for different environments:
```bash
# Healthcare setup commands
bun run healthcare:setup         # Uses current environment
bun run healthcare:setup:local   # Forces local database
bun run healthcare:setup:dev     # Forces development database

# Start with healthcare
bun run local:healthcare         # Start local with healthcare setup
bun run dev:healthcare          # Start dev with healthcare setup
bun run start:healthcare        # Start with auto-detected environment
```

### 5. Demo Data
The setup script creates:
- 1 hospital: Dubai Central Hospital
- 4 users with healthcare roles:
  - Operator: johncena@gmail.com
  - Nurse: doremon@gmail.com
  - Doctor: johndoe@gmail.com
  - Head Doctor: saipramod273@gmail.com
- 3 sample alerts with different urgency levels

## üìã How to Use

### For Local Development (Docker PostgreSQL)
```bash
# Option 1: Use the local healthcare command
bun run local:healthcare

# Option 2: Use the unified script
APP_ENV=local ./scripts/start-with-healthcare.sh

# Option 3: Manual setup then start
bun run healthcare:setup:local
bun run local
```

### For Development/Staging (Neon Cloud)
```bash
# Option 1: Use the dev healthcare command
bun run dev:healthcare

# Option 2: Use the unified script
APP_ENV=development ./scripts/start-with-healthcare.sh
```

### Manual Healthcare Setup Only
```bash
# Setup for current environment
bun run healthcare:setup

# Setup for specific environment
APP_ENV=local bun run healthcare:setup
APP_ENV=development bun run healthcare:setup
```

## üîß Environment Detection

The system determines which database to use based on:
1. `APP_ENV` environment variable (highest priority)
2. `DATABASE_URL` content (checks for localhost/127.0.0.1)
3. Default to local if not specified

## üìù Demo Credentials

All demo users can login with any password (Better Auth allows this for demo purposes):
- **Operator**: johncena@gmail.com
- **Nurse**: doremon@gmail.com  
- **Doctor**: johndoe@gmail.com
- **Head Doctor**: saipramod273@gmail.com

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Start the app with healthcare: `bun run local:healthcare`
2. Access at: http://localhost:8081
3. Login with any of the demo credentials
4. Test the Hospital Alert System features

## üêõ Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Ensure Docker is running: `docker ps`
2. Check database connection: `docker exec myexpo-postgres-local psql -U myexpo -d myexpo_dev -c "\dt"`
3. Reset and retry: `bun run db:local:reset && bun run healthcare:setup:local`
4. Check logs: `docker logs myexpo-postgres-local`
