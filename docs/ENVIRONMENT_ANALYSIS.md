# Environment Analysis - Tab Reload Issue

## Problem Statement
The app completely reinitializes when switching tabs, showing "Running application 'main'" in console logs.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Stack.Protected Issue ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: `Stack.Protected` with guard was causing entire Stack to remount on navigation state changes
- **Solution**: Removed `Stack.Protected` and handle auth at screen level
- **Status**: Fixed in `app/_layout.tsx`

### 2. AuthSync Navigation Logic ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: AuthSync had navigation logic in useEffect with segments dependency
- **Solution**: Removed all navigation logic from AuthSync - it now only syncs state
- **Status**: Fixed in `components/AuthSync.tsx`

### 3. Multiple Navigation Triggers
- **Problem**: Multiple components trying to handle navigation simultaneously
- **Solution**: Centralized navigation logic to `app/index.tsx` only
- **Status**: Fixed

## Key Changes Made

### app/_layout.tsx
```diff
- <Stack.Protected guard={isAuthenticated}>
-   <Stack.Screen name="(home)" />
-   <Stack.Screen name="index" />
- </Stack.Protected>
+ {/* All Routes - Protection handled at screen level */}
+ <Stack.Screen name="(auth)" />
+ <Stack.Screen name="(home)" />
+ <Stack.Screen name="index" />
```

### components/AuthSync.tsx
- Removed all `router.replace()` and `router.push()` calls
- Removed `useRouter` and `useSegments` imports
- Now only syncs auth state with server using TanStack Query
- No navigation side effects

## Verification Steps

1. **Test Tab Navigation**:
   - Login to the app
   - Switch between tabs (Home, Explore, Manager, Admin)
   - Console should NOT show "Running application 'main'" on tab switches
   - App should NOT reload/reinitialize

2. **Test Auth Flow**:
   - Logout and verify redirect to login
   - Login and verify redirect to home
   - All handled by `app/index.tsx`

3. **Monitor Console**:
   - Look for `TAB_DEBUG` logs from TabReloadDebugger
   - Should show navigation state changes without app reinitialization

## Expected Behavior

- Tab switches should be instant
- No app reinitialization
- Navigation state changes logged without remounting
- Auth state synced in background without navigation side effects

## Additional Debugging

If issues persist:
1. Check for `global.css` multiple imports
2. Verify no other components are using `router.replace` in effects
3. Monitor TanStack Query cache invalidations
4. Check for circular dependencies in imports

## Summary

The main issue was navigation logic scattered across multiple components causing conflicts. By centralizing navigation to `app/index.tsx` and removing `Stack.Protected`, tab navigation should now work smoothly without app reinitialization.
