# UX Research Plan - Hospital Alert System

## 🎯 Research Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Understand emergency workflows** - How alerts are currently handled
2. **Identify pain points** - What slows down response times
3. **Define success criteria** - What makes an alert system effective
4. **Validate design concepts** - Test solutions with real users

### Key Questions
- How do operators decide alert urgency?
- What information do healthcare staff need immediately?
- How do escalations currently work?
- What are the most common failure points?
- How do night shifts differ from day shifts?
