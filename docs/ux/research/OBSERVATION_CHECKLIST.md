- [ ] Frustration expressions
- [ ] Fatigue indicators
- [ ] Cognitive overload signs
- [ ] Training gaps

## üìä Specific Scenarios to Track

### Scenario 1: Single Alert Flow

- [ ] Time elapsed
- [ ] Outcome

### Scenario 2: Multiple Simultaneous Alerts
- [ ] Prioritization method
- [ ] Switching between alerts
- [ ] Information retention
- [ ] Delegation decisions
- [ ] Stress level changes
- [ ] Resolution order

### Scenario 3: Shift Change
- [ ] Handover process
- [ ] Information transferred
- [ ] Active alert handling
- [ ] System status check
- [ ] Knowledge gaps
- [ ] Time required

### Scenario 4: Emergency Escalation
- [ ] Escalation triggers
- [ ] Communication cascade
- [ ] Response coordination
- [ ] Leadership involvement
- [ ] Time to resolution
- [ ] Lessons learned

## üïê Time-Based Observations

### Day Shift (7 AM - 7 PM)
- [ ] Peak alert times
- [ ] Staffing levels
