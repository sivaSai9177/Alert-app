## üéØ Immediate Next Steps

### This Week: UX Research Sprint
1. **Schedule user interviews** - Contact hospitals
2. **Prepare research materials** - Interview guides
3. **Set up design tools** - Figma workspace
4. **Recruit test users** - Healthcare professionals
5. **Define success criteria** - Measurable goals

### Design Deliverables Due
- User personas (by Day 3)
- Journey maps (by Day 5)
- Wireframes (by Day 7)
- Prototypes (by Day 10)
- Final designs (by Day 14)

## üìù Updated Technical Decisions

### What We're Building (MVP)
```typescript
// Simplified auth without 2FA
interface MVPAuthFeatures {
  emailPasswordLogin: true;
  googleOAuth: true;
  profileCompletion: true;
  sessionManagement: true;
  roleBasedAccess: true;
  // Deferred
  twoFactorAuth: false;
  passwordReset: false;
  emailVerification: false;
}

// Core healthcare features
interface MVPHealthcareFeatures {
  alertManagement: true;
  escalationSystem: true;
  pushNotifications: true;
  realtimeUpdates: true;
  basicAnalytics: true;
  auditLogging: true;
  // Deferred
  advancedReporting: false;
  teamManagement: false;
  multiHospital: false;
}
```

### Simplified User Flow (MVP)
```
1. Login ‚Üí 2. Dashboard ‚Üí 3. Action
   ‚Üì
   No password reset
   No email verification
   No 2FA
```

## üö® Risk Mitigation

### By Deferring 2FA & Password Reset
**Risks:**
- Reduced security
- No self-service recovery
- Manual admin intervention needed

**Mitigations:**
- Strong password requirements
- Session timeout (8 hours)
- Admin can force password reset
- Audit all auth events
- Plan for quick post-MVP addition

## üìÖ Revised Timeline

### MVP (10 weeks)
- **Weeks 1-2**: UX/UI Design ‚Üê CURRENT
- **Weeks 3-4**: Backend completion
- **Weeks 5-7**: Frontend implementation
- **Weeks 8-10**: Testing & launch

### Post-MVP (4 weeks)
- **Week 11**: 2FA implementation
- **Week 12**: Password reset flow
- **Week 13**: Email verification
- **Week 14**: Advanced features

## ‚úÖ Benefits of This Approach

1. **Faster MVP delivery** - 10 weeks vs 14 weeks
2. **Focus on core value** - Alert system first
3. **User-validated design** - Built right first time
4. **Reduced complexity** - Easier testing
5. **Quick iterations** - Add features based on feedback
