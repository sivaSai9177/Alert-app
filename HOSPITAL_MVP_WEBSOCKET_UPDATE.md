# Hospital MVP WebSocket Implementation Update

## Overview
We have successfully implemented a comprehensive WebSocket infrastructure for real-time updates in the Hospital Alert System. This implementation provides real-time subscriptions for alerts, patient vitals, and system metrics across iOS, Android, and Web platforms.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. WebSocket Server Infrastructure
- **Location**: `/src/server/websocket/server.ts`
- **Features**:
  - tRPC WebSocket adapter integration
  - Authentication via Bearer tokens
  - Connection lifecycle management
  - Automatic reconnection support

### 2. Connection Manager
- **Location**: `/src/server/websocket/connection-manager.ts`
- **Features**:
  - User/Hospital connection mapping
  - Heartbeat for connection health
  - Broadcast capabilities by hospital/role
  - Connection activity tracking

### 3. Real-time Event Service
- **Location**: `/src/server/services/realtime-events.ts`
- **Event Types**:
  - Alert events (created, acknowledged, resolved, escalated)
  - Vital signs updates with critical detection
  - Metrics updates
  - Mock data generator for development

### 4. Cross-Platform WebSocket Client
- **Location**: `/lib/trpc/websocket-client.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Unified API for React Native and Web
  - Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
  - Message queuing during disconnection
  - Authentication support

### 5. Healthcare State Management
- **Location**: `/lib/stores/healthcare-store.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Zustand store with immer middleware
  - Real-time state synchronization
  - Optimistic updates
  - Persistent UI preferences

## UI Components with Real-time Support

### AlertListBlock
- Real-time alert updates via WebSocket subscription
- Optimistic UI updates for acknowledgment/resolution
- Automatic cache invalidation on new events
- Toast notifications for new alerts

### PatientCardBlock
- Real-time vital signs monitoring
- Critical vitals detection and alerts
- Optimistic alert acknowledgment
- WebSocket subscription with fallback to polling

### MetricsOverviewBlock
- Real-time metrics updates
- Automatic refresh via subscriptions

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Enable WebSocket support
EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_WS=true

# WebSocket server port
EXPO_PUBLIC_WS_PORT=3001
```

### Starting the System
```bash
# Start with WebSocket support
bun run local:healthcare

# The WebSocket server will automatically start on port 3001
```

## Architecture Flow

```
Client (React Native/Web)
    ↓
tRPC Split Link
    ↓
├── HTTP Link (queries/mutations)
└── WebSocket Link (subscriptions)
    ↓
WebSocket Server (port 3001)
    ↓
Connection Manager
    ↓
Real-time Event Service
    ↓
Database/Event Emitters
```

## Key Features

### 1. Authentication
- WebSocket connections authenticate using Bearer tokens
- Tokens passed as query parameters or headers
- User context available in subscriptions

### 2. Event Routing
- Hospital-specific event channels
- Role-based event filtering
- Patient-specific vital subscriptions

### 3. Resilience
- Automatic reconnection on disconnect
- Message queuing during outages
- Heartbeat for connection health
- Graceful shutdown handling

### 4. Performance
- Event debouncing for high-frequency updates
- Selective subscription management
- Efficient broadcast algorithms

## Usage Examples

### Subscribe to Alerts (Frontend)
```typescript
const { data } = api.healthcare.subscribeToAlerts.useSubscription(
  { hospitalId },
  {
    enabled: !!hospitalId && process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_WS === 'true',
    onData: (event) => {
      // Handle real-time alert event
      console.log('New alert event:', event);
    },
  }
);
```

### Emit Events (Backend)
```typescript
// In mutation handlers
await alertEventHelpers.emitAlertCreated(newAlert);
await alertEventHelpers.emitAlertAcknowledged(alertId, hospitalId, userId);
```

## Testing WebSocket Implementation

### 1. Web Testing
```bash
# Start the system
bun run local:healthcare

# Open browser to http://localhost:8081
# Navigate to Healthcare Dashboard
# Create alerts and observe real-time updates
```

### 2. Mobile Testing
```bash
# Start with tunnel for mobile
bun run local:healthcare:tunnel

# Use Expo Go or development build
# Check real-time updates work on device
```

### 3. Connection Testing
- Open multiple browser tabs/devices
- Create alert in one tab
- Verify it appears in real-time in other tabs
- Test acknowledgment/resolution synchronization

## Monitoring

### Logs to Watch
```bash
# WebSocket connections
[WS_SERVER] WebSocket server started
[WS_SERVER] WebSocket connection opened
[WS_CLIENT] WebSocket connected

# Real-time events
[REALTIME] Alert created event emitted
[HEALTHCARE] Alert subscription event

# Connection health
[CONNECTION_MANAGER] Connection added
[CONNECTION_MANAGER] Heartbeat check
```

## Troubleshooting

### WebSocket Not Connecting
1. Check `EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_WS=true` in `.env`
2. Verify port 3001 is not in use
3. Check browser console for connection errors

### Events Not Received
1. Verify subscription is enabled
2. Check user has correct permissions
3. Look for event emission logs

### Mobile Connection Issues
1. Use tunnel mode for mobile testing
2. Check network connectivity
3. Verify authentication tokens

## Next Steps

1. **Production Deployment**:
   - Configure WebSocket server for production
   - Set up WebSocket load balancing
   - Implement Redis for multi-server events

2. **Enhanced Features**:
   - Add presence indicators
   - Implement typing indicators
   - Add real-time collaboration features

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Add WebSocket metrics
   - Implement connection analytics
   - Set up alerting for failures

## Summary

The WebSocket implementation provides a robust, real-time communication layer for the Hospital Alert System. It seamlessly integrates with the existing tRPC infrastructure while providing cross-platform support and excellent developer experience.
