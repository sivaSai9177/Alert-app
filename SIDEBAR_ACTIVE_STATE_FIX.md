# Sidebar Active State Fix

## Issue
The sidebar navigation links did not have a visually distinct active color state, making it difficult for users to identify which page they were currently on. Additionally, the active state logic was incorrectly matching parent routes when on child routes.

## Solution
1. Updated the Sidebar07 component to use the primary theme color for active states instead of the accent color
2. Fixed the active state detection logic to use exact path matching
3. Updated the admin page's custom sidebar to match the main navigation styling

### Changes Made

#### 1. **Sidebar07MenuButton** (lines 610-616):
   - Changed active state background from `theme.accent` to `theme.primary`
   - This ensures a more prominent visual distinction for active navigation items

#### 2. **Icon Colors** (lines 862-863):
   - Updated active icon color from `theme.accentForeground` to `theme.primaryForeground`
   - Ensures proper contrast with the primary background

#### 3. **Text Colors** (lines 873-875):
   - Updated active text color from `theme.accentForeground` to `theme.primaryForeground`
   - Maintains readability on the primary background

#### 4. **Sub-navigation Items** (lines 780-784, 795-796):
   - Applied consistent primary color scheme to sub-navigation items
   - Active items use `theme.primary` background with `theme.primaryForeground` text

#### 5. **Project Navigation** (lines 1375-1383):
   - Updated project navigation items to use the same active state styling
   - Ensures consistency across all navigation elements

#### 6. **Active State Logic** (lines 827-839):
   - Fixed the pathname matching logic to use exact matches
   - Special handling for home route (/(home) and /(home)/index)
   - Prevents parent routes from appearing active when on child routes

#### 7. **Admin Page Sidebar** (admin.tsx):
   - Updated custom sidebar to use `theme.primary` for active background
   - Updated icon and text colors to use `theme.primaryForeground`
   - Ensures consistency with main navigation

## Result
- The active navigation state is now clearly visible across all themes
- Proper contrast between background and foreground colors
- Exact route matching prevents incorrect active states
- Consistent styling between main navigation and page-specific navigation

## Testing
The changes work correctly across all 5 built-in themes:
- Default (shadcn)
- Bubblegum
- Ocean
- Forest
- Sunset

Each theme's primary/primaryForeground combination provides appropriate contrast for accessibility.
