git_in_target commit -m "feat: Add unified environment configuration for OAuth compatibility

This commit introduces a unified environment system that solves OAuth authentication
issues with private IP addresses while maintaining mobile device connectivity.

BREAKING CHANGE: Environment configuration has been unified. Update your local
environment files according to .env.local.example.

## Problem Solved
- Google OAuth doesn't accept private IP addresses (192.168.x.x)
- Multiple environment files caused confusion
- Mobile devices couldn't connect when using localhost for OAuth

## Solution
Implemented a unified environment system that:
- Automatically detects environment mode (local/network/tunnel/production)
- Uses localhost for auth endpoints when on private networks
- Allows API access via network IP for mobile devices
- Provides clear, mode-based configuration

## Changes
- Add lib/core/unified-env.ts for centralized configuration
- Update auth modules to use OAuth-safe URLs
- Create unified start script for all scenarios
- Add new npm scripts for different modes
- Update existing modules to use unified configuration

## New Commands
\`\`\`bash
bun start:oauth    # OAuth testing (localhost only)
bun start          # Network mode (mobile + OAuth)
bun start:local    # Local development
bun start:tunnel   # Remote access
\`\`\`

## Migration Guide
1. Copy .env.local.example to .env.local
2. Update with your credentials
3. Use new unified commands
4. Remove old environment-specific files
