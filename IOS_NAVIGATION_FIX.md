# iOS Navigation Fix - Login Page Redirect Issue

## Problem
The login page redirect was not visible on iOS devices when using the `<Redirect>` component from expo-router.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated `/app/index.tsx`
- Changed from declarative `<Redirect>` component to imperative `router.replace()` navigation
- Added `useEffect` hook to handle navigation after auth state is hydrated
- Added a 100ms delay for iOS to ensure navigation stack is ready
- Added visual debugging with platform information

### 2. Enhanced Auth Layout (`/app/(auth)/_layout.tsx`)
- Added console logging for debugging auth state
- Added visual loading indicator while auth is hydrating
- Added platform-specific logging

### 3. Enhanced Login Screen
- Added platform and dimension logging
- Added mount/unmount lifecycle logging

### 4. Created Debug Tools
- `/app/debug-navigation.tsx` - Interactive navigation testing screen
- `/app/test-navigation.tsx` - Automatic navigation test with 2-second delay
- `/app/index-minimal.tsx` - Minimal index without auth for testing pure navigation

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test with the updated index.tsx:**
   ```bash
   bun start
   ```
   - Open in Expo Go on iOS
   - Check console logs for navigation flow
   - Should see loading screen then redirect to login

2. **Test with debug navigation screen:**
   - Navigate to `/debug-navigation` in the app
   - Test both push and replace navigation methods
   - Verify which method works on iOS

3. **Test with minimal index:**
   - Temporarily rename `index.tsx` to `index.backup.tsx`
   - Rename `index-minimal.tsx` to `index.tsx`
   - Test if direct navigation without auth works

## Key Changes

1. **Imperative Navigation**: Using `router.replace()` instead of `<Redirect>` component
2. **Navigation Timing**: Added small delay for iOS to ensure navigation stack is ready
3. **Visual Feedback**: Added loading indicators and platform information
4. **Debugging**: Extensive console logging to track navigation flow

## Console Logs to Check

Look for these logs in order:
1. `[RootLayout] Rendering, Platform: ios`
2. `[Index] Component rendering`
3. `[Index] Auth state: ...`
4. `[Index] Checking navigation...`
5. `[Index] Navigating to login`
6. `[AuthLayout] Component rendering`
7. `[LoginScreen] Component mounting`

## Rollback Instructions

If needed, restore the original index.tsx:
```bash
cp /Users/sirigiri/Documents/coding-projects/my-expo/app/index.tsx.backup /Users/sirigiri/Documents/coding-projects/my-expo/app/index.tsx
```

## Next Steps

1. Test the navigation on actual iOS device/simulator
2. Monitor console logs to identify where navigation might be failing
3. If issue persists, try the debug navigation screens to isolate the problem
4. Consider using `router.push()` instead of `router.replace()` if replace is not working on iOS
