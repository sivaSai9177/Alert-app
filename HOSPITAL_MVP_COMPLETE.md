## üöÄ How to Test the MVP

### 1. Start the System

```bash
# Use OAuth-friendly mode for testing
bun start:oauth

# Or use network mode for mobile testing
bun start
```

### 2. Setup Test Users

1. **Create an Admin Account**:
   - Register with email/password or Google OAuth
   - Complete profile with "Admin" role
   - Organization: "Test Hospital"

2. **Create Test Healthcare Users**:
   - Operator: For creating alerts
   - Nurse: For tier 1 response
   - Doctor: For tier 2 response
   - Head Doctor: For tier 3 response

### 3. Test Alert Flow

1. **Login as Operator**
   - Navigate to home screen
   - Click "Create Alert"
   - Fill in:
     - Room: 101
     - Type: Emergency
     - Urgency: High (4)
     - Description: "Patient needs immediate assistance"
   - Submit alert

2. **Login as Nurse**
   - See new alert on dashboard
   - Watch escalation timer counting down
   - Click alert to expand
   - Click "Acknowledge Alert"
   - Alert moves to "In Progress"

3. **Login as Doctor**
   - See acknowledged alert
   - Can resolve with notes
   - Watch escalation timer if not resolved

4. **Test Escalation**
   - Create alert but don't acknowledge
   - Wait for timer (configurable, default 5 minutes)
   - Alert escalates to doctors
   - Continue to head doctor if needed

### 4. Real-Time Features

- Open multiple browser windows
- Login as different users
- Create alert in one window
- See it appear instantly in others
- Acknowledge in one window
- See status update in all windows

## üì± Mobile Testing

```bash
# Start in network mode
bun start

# Note the IP address shown
# Open Expo Go on your phone
# Scan QR code or enter URL
```

## üîß Configuration

### Escalation Timers (in types/healthcare.ts)
```typescript
export const HEALTHCARE_ESCALATION_TIERS = [
  { tier: 1, notify_roles: ['nurse'], timeout_minutes: 5 },
  { tier: 2, notify_roles: ['doctor'], timeout_minutes: 10 },
  { tier: 3, notify_roles: ['head_doctor'], timeout_minutes: 15 },
];
```

### Alert Types & Urgency
- Configured in `types/healthcare.ts`
- Visual indicators and colors
- Customizable per hospital needs

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Frontend
- **React Native** with Expo
- **TanStack Query** for state management
- **tRPC** for type-safe API
- **Universal Components** with theming
- **React 19** optimizations

### Backend
- **tRPC** router with subscriptions
- **Better Auth** for authentication
- **Drizzle ORM** with PostgreSQL
- **Event-driven** architecture
- **Background services** for escalation

### Real-Time
- **tRPC Subscriptions** (SSE-based)
- **Event emitters** for alert events
- **TanStack Query** cache invalidation
- **Optimistic updates** support

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Permission-based procedures
- Audit logging for all actions
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting on critical endpoints

## üìä Next Steps

### Phase 2 Features
1. **Push Notifications**
   - Expo Push Notifications
   - SMS integration for critical alerts
   - Email notifications

2. **Analytics Dashboard**
   - Response time metrics
   - Alert volume trends
   - Staff performance metrics

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Alert templates
   - Shift scheduling
   - Multi-hospital support
   - Alert categories/departments

4. **Mobile Optimizations**
   - Offline support
   - Background sync
   - Native device features

## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Notifications**: Currently shows in-app alerts only
2. **Offline Mode**: Not yet implemented
3. **Performance**: May need optimization for 100+ concurrent alerts
4. **Testing**: Automated tests not yet implemented
