COMMIT_MESSAGE="feat: Add unified environment configuration for OAuth compatibility

This commit introduces a unified environment system that solves OAuth authentication
issues with private IP addresses while maintaining mobile device connectivity.

## Changes

### New Files
- lib/core/unified-env.ts - Centralized environment configuration
- scripts/start-unified.sh - Unified start script for all modes
- .env.local.example - Template for local OAuth configuration

### Updated Files
- lib/auth/auth.ts - Uses getAuthBaseUrl() from unified-env
- lib/auth/auth-client.ts - Uses OAuth-safe URLs
- lib/trpc.tsx - Uses unified API URL  
- lib/core/env.ts - Exports unified functions
- package.json - Added unified scripts (start:oauth, start:local, etc.)

## Features
- ‚úÖ OAuth works with private IP addresses (192.168.x.x)
- ‚úÖ Automatic mode detection (local/network/tunnel/production)
- ‚úÖ Mobile devices can connect while OAuth remains functional
- ‚úÖ Single configuration system for all scenarios
- ‚úÖ Platform-specific URL handling (iOS/Android/Web)

## New Commands
- \`bun start:oauth\` - OAuth testing mode (localhost only)
- \`bun start\` - Network mode (mobile devices via IP)
- \`bun start:local\` - Local development mode
- \`bun start:tunnel\` - Remote access via Expo tunnel

## Technical Details
The unified environment system automatically:
1. Detects the current environment mode
2. Uses localhost for auth when on private networks (OAuth requirement)
3. Allows API access via network IP for mobile devices
4. Handles platform-specific differences transparently

## Testing
All modes have been configured and tested:
- OAuth authentication flow works correctly
- Mobile devices can connect in network mode
- Profile completion flow functions properly
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

Fixes OAuth authentication issues reported with private IP addresses."
