# Admin Page Mobile Fix & UI Update

## Issue
The admin page was not rendering properly on mobile devices. The page had its own sidebar implementation that was conflicting with the main app navigation structure, causing layout issues.

## Solution
1. Simplified the admin page to work within the existing app layout structure
2. Updated the UI to match the explore page pattern with horizontal scrollable category pills

## Changes Made

### Phase 1: Fixed Layout Issues
1. **Removed custom sidebar** - The admin page was creating its own sidebar navigation, which was unnecessary since the app already has a main navigation sidebar
2. **Unified layout** - Both desktop and mobile now use the same layout structure
3. **Proper Container usage** - Added padding to Container component and ensured proper scroll behavior
4. **Responsive stats cards** - Reduced minWidth from 200 to 150 for better mobile display

### Phase 2: Updated to Match Explore Page Pattern
1. **Replaced Tabs with Category Pills** - Now uses horizontal scrollable category selector like the explore page
2. **Added Sidebar Toggle** - Included Sidebar07Trigger in the header for web
3. **Consistent Header Structure** - Breadcrumb navigation and page header match other pages
4. **Unified Layout** - No separate desktop/mobile layouts, single responsive design

### UI Components
- Uses ScrollContainer instead of Container for better scroll handling
- Category pills with icons, text, and optional badges
- Active state uses primary theme color with proper contrast
- Horizontal scroll for category navigation on all screen sizes

### Code Cleanup
- Removed unused state variable `isSidebarOpen`
- Removed device dimension calculations
- Removed conditional desktop/mobile rendering
- Simplified imports

## Result
The admin page now:
- Renders correctly on all devices
- Matches the explore page UI pattern for consistency
- Uses responsive horizontal scrollable categories
- Works seamlessly within the app's navigation structure
- Provides a clean, modern interface for admin functions
