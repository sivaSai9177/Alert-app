### Console Statements
- Multiple console.log statements remain (cleanup needed)

## 4. API Integration Status

### ✅ Fully Integrated
- Authentication endpoints
- Healthcare CRUD operations
- Real-time WebSocket subscriptions
- Notification services
- Organization management

### ⚠️ Partially Integrated
- Some dashboard blocks use mock data

- Role-based access control
- Organization-level data isolation
- Input validation with Zod
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting

## 10. Risk Assessment

### High Risk Issues
1. **Production Readiness** - Code quality issues could cause runtime errors
2. **Security** - Missing 2FA and API key management
3. **Scalability** - No performance testing under load
4. **Compliance** - Activity logs UI needed for HIPAA

### Medium Risk Issues
1. **User Experience** - Missing features may frustrate users
2. **Maintenance** - Technical debt will slow development
3. **Testing** - Limited coverage increases bug risk
4. **Documentation** - Incomplete docs hinder onboarding

### Mitigation Strategy
1. Dedicated sprint for code quality fixes
2. Security audit before production
3. Load testing with realistic data
4. Complete critical missing features
5. Establish code review process

## Conclusion

The Hospital Alert System has achieved impressive functionality with 98% of core features complete. However, code quality issues and testing gaps present risks for production deployment. With 1-2 weeks of focused effort on the immediate actions listed above, the system will be fully production-ready.

**Recommendation**: Schedule a code quality sprint before production deployment to address critical issues and ensure system reliability.
