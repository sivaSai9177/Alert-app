# iOS Physical Device Healthcare Fix Summary

## Problem
When running `bun run local:healthcare` on iOS physical devices, all API calls were failing with "Network request failed" because the app was using `localhost:8081` instead of the device's network IP (`192.168.1.9:8081`).

## Root Cause
The `local:healthcare` script was setting `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8081`, which overrides the dynamic environment detection. iOS physical devices cannot access `localhost` as it refers to the device itself, not the development machine.

## Solution
Created a new iOS-specific healthcare startup script that:
1. Auto-detects the machine's network IP address
2. Sets `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` to use the network IP instead of localhost
3. Configures all necessary environment variables for iOS devices
4. Sets up healthcare tables and demo data
5. Starts the WebSocket server with proper network configuration
6. Launches Expo with explicit host configuration

## Usage
```bash
# For iOS physical devices
bun run ios:healthcare
```

This command will:
- Detect your machine's IP (e.g., 192.168.1.9)
- Configure the app to use `http://192.168.1.9:8081` for all API calls
- Set up healthcare demo data
- Start WebSocket server on `ws://192.168.1.9:3001`
- Display connection instructions for Expo Go

## Key Changes Made

### 1. New Script: `/scripts/ios-healthcare.sh`
- Auto-detects network IP using `ipconfig getifaddr en0`
- Sets `REACT_NATIVE_PACKAGER_HOSTNAME` for React Native
- Sets `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` with network IP
- Configures WebSocket URL with network IP
- Starts services with proper network host

### 2. Updated Package.json
Added new command:
```json
"ios:healthcare": "./scripts/ios-healthcare.sh"
```

### 3. Enhanced Environment Detection
The unified environment system now better handles iOS physical devices by:
- Prioritizing network mode for iOS devices
- Checking multiple manifest properties for IP detection
- Never using localhost for iOS physical devices

## Testing
1. Connect your iPhone to the same WiFi network as your development machine
2. Run `bun run ios:healthcare`
3. Note the displayed IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.9)
4. Open Expo Go on your iPhone
5. Tap "Enter URL manually"
6. Enter `exp://192.168.1.9:8081`
7. The app should load with working authentication and API calls

## Benefits
- ✅ No more "Network request failed" errors on iOS devices
- ✅ Automatic IP detection - no manual configuration needed
- ✅ Healthcare features work properly on physical devices
- ✅ WebSocket connections work with correct network URLs
- ✅ Single command setup for iOS testing
