## üéØ Module Implementation Workflows

### üîê Authentication Module Workflows

#### Workflow 1: User Registration Flow
```yaml
Trigger: User clicks "Sign Up"
Actors: New User, System

Steps:
  1. User Input:
     - Email validation (RFC 5322)
     - Password strength check (min 8 chars, 1 upper, 1 number)
     - Role selection (operator/doctor/nurse)
     
  2. Frontend Processing:
     Code: /app/(auth)/register.tsx
     - Form validation using react-hook-form
     - Show real-time validation feedback
     - Disable submit until valid
     
  3. API Call:
     Endpoint: api.auth.signUp
     Payload: { email, password, role, name }
     
  4. Backend Processing:
     Code: /src/server/routers/auth.ts
     - Check email uniqueness
     - Hash password (bcrypt, 10 rounds)
     - Create user record
     - Generate verification token
     - Send verification email (future)
     
  5. Response Handling:
     Success: 
       - Create session
       - Store token
       - Redirect to profile completion
     Error:
       - Show specific error message
       - Retain form data
       - Log error for monitoring

Validation Rules:
  - Email: Must be unique, valid format
  - Password: Min 8 chars, complexity rules
  - Role: Must be valid healthcare role
  
Error Scenarios:
  - Duplicate email: "Email already registered"
  - Weak password: Show strength indicator
  - Network error: "Unable to connect. Please try again."
  - Server error: "Something went wrong. Please try again."
```

#### Workflow 2: OAuth Login Flow (Google)
```yaml
Trigger: User clicks "Sign in with Google"
Actors: User, Google OAuth, System

Steps:
  1. OAuth Initiation:
     Code: /components/GoogleSignInButton.tsx
     - Open OAuth popup/redirect
     - Request profile scope
     
  2. Google Authentication:
     - User authenticates with Google
     - Google redirects with auth code
     
  3. Callback Processing:
     Code: /app/auth-callback.tsx
     - Extract auth code
     - Exchange for tokens
     
  4. Backend Processing:
     Code: /src/server/routers/auth.ts
     - Verify Google tokens
     - Check if user exists
     - If new: Create user with needsProfileCompletion
     - If existing: Update last login
     
  5. Profile Check:
     If needsProfileCompletion:
       - Redirect to /complete-profile
     Else:
       - Redirect to role-based dashboard
       
Special Considerations:
  - Mobile: Use expo-auth-session
  - Web: Use popup/redirect flow
  - Handle popup blockers gracefully
```

#### Workflow 3: Session Management
```yaml
Background Process: Continuous
Actors: System, User

Token Refresh Flow:
  1. Check token expiry every 5 minutes
  2. If expires in < 10 minutes:
     - Call api.auth.refreshToken
     - Update stored token
     - Reset expiry timer
     
  3. If refresh fails:
     - Clear auth state
     - Redirect to login
     - Show "Session expired" message

Multi-Device Session:
  1. Track device fingerprint
  2. Store device name/type
  3. Allow user to view active sessions
  4. Provide "Logout from all devices" option
  
Security Measures:
  - Rotate refresh tokens on use
  - Invalidate old tokens
  - Track suspicious activity
  - Geographic anomaly detection
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Optimistic Updates
```typescript
// Frontend immediately updates UI
const createAlert = async (data: AlertData) => {
  // 1. Optimistic update
  const tempId = generateTempId();
  alertStore.addAlert({ ...data, id: tempId, status: 'sending' });
  
  try {
    // 2. API call
    const alert = await api.alerts.create.mutate(data);
    
    // 3. Replace temp with real
    alertStore.replaceAlert(tempId, alert);
  } catch (error) {
    // 4. Rollback on failure
    alertStore.removeAlert(tempId);
    showError('Failed to create alert');
  }
};
```

### Pattern 2: Retry with Backoff
```typescript
// Notification delivery with retry
const deliverNotification = async (
  userId: string, 
  message: NotificationMessage,
  attempt = 1
): Promise<void> => {
  try {
    await pushService.send(userId, message);
    await logDelivery(userId, message, 'success');
  } catch (error) {
    if (attempt < MAX_RETRIES) {
      const delay = Math.pow(2, attempt) * 1000; // Exponential backoff
      await sleep(delay);
      return deliverNotification(userId, message, attempt + 1);
    } else {
      await logDelivery(userId, message, 'failed');
      await fallbackDelivery(userId, message);
    }
  }
};
```

### Pattern 3: Circuit Breaker
```typescript
// Prevent cascading failures
class NotificationCircuitBreaker {
  private failures = 0;
  private lastFailTime = 0;
  private state: 'closed' | 'open' | 'half-open' = 'closed';
  
  async execute<T>(operation: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T> {
    if (this.state === 'open') {
      if (Date.now() - this.lastFailTime > RECOVERY_TIMEOUT) {
        this.state = 'half-open';
      } else {
        throw new Error('Circuit breaker is open');
      }
    }
    
    try {
      const result = await operation();
      this.onSuccess();
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      this.onFailure();
      throw error;
    }
  }
  
  private onSuccess() {
    this.failures = 0;
    this.state = 'closed';
  }
  
  private onFailure() {
    this.failures++;
    this.lastFailTime = Date.now();
    
    if (this.failures >= FAILURE_THRESHOLD) {
      this.state = 'open';
    }
  }
}
```
