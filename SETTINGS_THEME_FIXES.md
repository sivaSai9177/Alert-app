# Settings Theme Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Dark Mode Switch Color**
The Switch component was already properly configured to use the primary theme color:
- Track color when ON: `theme.primary`
- Track color when OFF: `theme.border`
- Thumb color adapts based on platform

**Implementation in Switch component:**
```typescript
trackColor={{
  false: theme.border,
  true: theme.primary,
}}
```

### 2. **Display Density Icons Theming**
Fixed the display density selector icons to properly adapt to the theme:

**Problem**: Icons were using hardcoded colors that didn't adapt to light/dark mode
**Solution**: 
1. Updated TabsTrigger to apply the correct color to icons based on active state
2. Icons now use `React.cloneElement` to override color props dynamically
3. Color logic:
   - Active tab: `theme.foreground` 
   - Inactive tab: `theme.mutedForeground`
   - Disabled: `theme.mutedForeground` with 50% opacity

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// In TabsTrigger
{React.cloneElement(icon as React.ReactElement, {
  color: getTextColor(),
})}
```

## Visual Results

### Light Mode:
- Switch shows primary color (dark) when enabled
- Icons show proper contrast (dark icons on light background)
- Active tab icons are darker (foreground color)
- Inactive tab icons are muted

### Dark Mode:
- Switch shows primary color (light) when enabled
- Icons show proper contrast (light icons on dark background)
- Active tab icons are lighter (foreground color)
- Inactive tab icons are muted

## Technical Details

1. **Switch Component**: Already had proper theming, no changes needed
2. **TabsTrigger Component**: Enhanced to override icon colors dynamically
3. **SpacingDensitySelector**: Updated to provide base color that gets overridden
4. **DarkModeToggle**: Cleaned up spacing implementation

The components now properly respond to theme changes and provide consistent visual feedback across light and dark modes.
